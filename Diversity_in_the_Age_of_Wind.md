# Important concepts in the Age of Wind
In recent IT trend terms, there are words like DevOps and Agile development.<br>
When you search online, DevOps is described as a mechanism that seamlessly integrates system development and operations, while Agile development is a method that progresses system development by repeatedly implementing and testing in small units.<br> 
However, that is just the surface meaning, and I believe the essential meaning is as follows:

- Agile Development → Pursue uniqueness
- DevOps → Regardless of job type, help each other beyond positions,<br> 
　　　　　It’s important to continue growing, even if the differences are minute

These are important ways of thinking in the Age of Wind, and through trend terms, aliens are conveying to us what is necessary on a higher dimension. <br>
So, what should we do to achieve ‘pursuing uniqueness,’ ‘helping each other,’ and ‘continuing to grow’? <br>
It is to live thinking about fun things without harboring forbidden thoughts.

- Forbidden thoughts → Do not harbor hatred, jealousy, envy, curses, anger, complaints, dissatisfaction, doubt, hesitation, worry, blame, irritation, haste, or a servile mindset

In everyday life, various emotions sprout, but by thinking and acting as much as possible on things that can make one’s life positive, one will be surrounded by people with the same mindset, where naturally help will arise, and one will be placed in an environment where one can continue to grow happily. <br>
On Earth, which has transitioned to the fifth dimension, I earnestly hope that it will continue to be a world that values diversity.
